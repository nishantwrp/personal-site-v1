# nishantwrp-website
> **Note**: I've migrated to a new minimalistic personal site & blog that is deployed at [nishantwrp.com](https://www.nishantwrp.com/).

This is the source code for my website which is live at [site-v1.nishantwrp.com](https://site-v1.nishantwrp.com/).

## Technologies Used
- [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) - I have used gridsome to generate a static site for the site to be SEO Friendly.
- [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) - I have used Contentful as the CMS for this site.
- [Vue Js](https://vuejs.org/) - Well this is obvious by the fact that I'm using Gridsome.
- [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) - I have used Vuetify as the UI framework.
